## Events
### Artists
As an artist, host your own events by navigating to your profile page and click the 'Create Event' button. Fill in some basic information, such as an event name, the ticket price, and when the event will be held. *We don't need to worry about the 'where' since we will all be virtual!* Once the countdown reaches zero, click the 'Go Live' button and start streaming!

### Users
As a user, feel free to browse and discover events that peak your interest. Log in to purchase a ticket and secure your spot! See a list of your purchased events (and even refund a ticket!) by navigating to your profile. Once the event countdown reaches zero, just wait for the artist to start streaming, and you will be redirected to the event!

## Live Chat

Interact with artist or your fans during an event using our real-time chat. Use the preloaded emojis to express your enjoyment!
